# 🔗 Blockchain Simulations

Welcome to **Blockchain Simulations** – a hands-on project built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to help students, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts understand how key blockchain components and consensus mechanisms work under the hood.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains interactive simulations of core blockchain concepts:

1. **Tamper Detection through Hash Linking**
2. **Proof of Work Mining Simulation**
3. **Consensus Mechanism Visualization**:
   - Proof of Work (PoW)
   - Proof of Stake (PoS)
   - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

These simulations are entirely frontend-based and designed for educational use. They visually represent how data is secured, how blocks are mined, and how network consensus is achieved in different systems.

## 🚀 Technologies Simulated

### 🧱 1. Block Hash Chaining and Tampering
- Demonstrates how each block links to the previous one using hashes.
- Shows real-time validation/invalidation when a block is tampered with.
- Teaches the principle of **immutability** in blockchain.

### ⚒️ 2. Nonce Mining (Proof of Work)
- Simulates block mining by finding a nonce that satisfies a hash difficulty.
- Includes crash protection if mining takes too long.
- Offers visual feedback of mining progress and performance time.

### 🗳️ 3. Consensus Mechanism Simulations
- Compares **PoW**, **PoS**, and **DPoS** with mock candidates and validators.
- Randomized data generation shows different selection logic.
- Output includes clear explanation of why a particular validator won.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By using this simulation, users will:

- Understand how blockchains detect tampering through hash dependencies.
- Learn how mining works and why it requires computational effort.
- Visualize the difference between various consensus mechanisms.
- Grasp the trade-offs in energy, fairness, and scalability between PoW, PoS, and DPoS.

## 🙏 Credits

This project was developed as part of a **mini-task submission** during my internship at [**BlockseBlock**](https://blockseblock.com/). I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at BlockseBlock for providing a valuable learning opportunity that helped me explore and simulate fundamental blockchain principles in a practical and interactive way.
